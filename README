Kitchen.core Module

:Version: 0.1.x

The Kitchen module provides a python API for all sorts of little useful
snippets of code that everybody ends up writing for their projects but never
seem big enough to build an independent release.  Use kitchen and stop cutting
and pasting that code over and over.

Soft Requirements
=================

If found, these libraries will be used to make the implementation of soemthing
better in some way.  If they are not present, the API that they enable will
still exist but may function in a different manner.

:chardet: Used in kitchen.text.xml.guess_encoding__to_xml() to help guess encoding of
    byte strings being converted.  If not present, unknown encodings will be
    converted as if they were latin1.
